Vessels delivers fleet command for maritime operators: sanctions screening, dark-vessel detection, ownership graph analysis, and voyage analytics — built on public AIS feeds with commercial-grade enrichment.

## What Vessels does

- **Fleet command** — live position, voyage state, alarms.
- **Sanctions screening** — ownership and beneficial-owner graph traversal.
- **Dark-vessel detection** — AIS gap analysis with anomaly scoring.
- **Voyage analytics** — route, dwell, port performance, exposure.
- **Compliance audit pack** — evidence bundled per voyage for export controls.

## Architecture

Vessels is a domain surface on the SZL Holdings platform. Every action is routed through the same governed pipeline:

```
sense → structure → correlate → explain → recommend → approve → execute → proof
```

The execution fabric is [**A11oy**](https://github.com/szl-holdings/a11oy). The bounded-loop kernel underneath every domain pack is [**ouroboros**](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros) — implementing the [Lutar Invariant](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros-thesis) for measurable convergence with auditable closure.

## Status

**Alpha.** Vessels is under active development as part of the SZL Holdings platform. Public releases are tagged via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/szl-holdings/vessels/releases). Security disclosures: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Security & governance

- CI on every push and pull request
- CodeQL static analysis on the default branch and every PR
- OpenSSF Scorecard published weekly, score visible in the badge above
- Dependabot updates, weekly cadence, SHA-pinned actions
- Secret scanning and push protection enabled
- Branch protection: signed commits, required reviews, no force push, no deletion
- Reusable workflows pinned to commit SHAs ([szl-holdings/.github](https://github.com/szl-holdings/.github))

## Mechanisms it inherits

The vessels surface inherits the same six machine-verified mechanisms as every other SZL surface:

| # | Mechanism | Where it's proven |
|---|---|---|
| I | Λ-gate (9-axis Lutar Invariant) | [`lutar-lean/Lutar/Invariant.lean`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/lutar-lean/blob/main/Lutar/Invariant.lean) |
| II | Receipt chain (signed bounded recursion) | [`szl-holdings/ouroboros`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros) v6.2 substrate |
| III | Bekenstein gate (information-bounded admit) | Paper v11 §3.3 |
| IV | Dual-witness verdict (MATCH/DIVERGE) | Paper v11 §3.4 |
| V | Witness diversity (Gauss class-number gating) | Paper v12 §4 (in review) |
| VI | Reference-vector parity (bit-exact across runtimes) | [`RefVectors.lean`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/lutar-lean/blob/main/RefVectors.lean) |

Verified test counts: ouroboros runtime **218/218**; full platform monorepo **1,220 tests across 76 packages** (incl. MCP gateway 27/27 e2e). Paper line v1–v11 published on Zenodo (concept DOI [10.5281/zenodo.19944926](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19944926)); v12 in review ([thesis PR #25](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros-thesis/pull/25)).
